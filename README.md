## 1.NASA bearing dataset

Retrieved from [here](http://data-acoustics.com/measurements/bearing-faults/bearing-4/)

### Measurement Date:
N/A

### Description:

Three sets of data each consisting of four bearings were **run to failure** under constant load and running conditions. The vibration measurement signals are provided for the datasets over the lifetime of the bearings until failure. Failure occurred after 100 million cycles with a crack in the outer race.

### Measured by:
